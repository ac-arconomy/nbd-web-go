								<p>
									Natural By Design runs intimate, 2-3 hour workshops based around natural health, wellness and the environment.
									We want you to come have a good time, learn to make something new and enjoy a glass or organic wine or try a kombucha cocktail.
									Did we mention the amazing grazing platters?!
								</p>
								<p>
									But wait.. that’s not all we’re about! I mean.. it’s a big part of it..
									but we’re also a community.
									We provide support for personal growth and create a safe place where you can learn and share ideas.
									We have a passionate community of Naturopaths, Nutritionists and Horticulturalist (for all those fellow plant lovers).
									Come find your holistic balance and be part of something special... let’s grow this community together.
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>

								<p>Hi there, I'm Ashlee and I created Natural By Design.
									Now everyone has a story so here's mine..</p>

								<p>I am a crazy, always singing (loudly), always dancing (badly), left shoe on my right foot kinda girl.
								Years ago I was a mad work-a-holic and not the work smart kind but the kill myself work hard kind.
								I did the whole long hours, poor diet and try to squeeze in a social life instead of sleep thing..
								now you've heard it before and you know where I'm going with this.. I fried myself!!
								That high energy craziness that I love about myself.. packed its suitcases and left behind a ghost of a person.
								My symptoms were so bad that they were testing me for Addison's Disease..
								when I think about it now I'm like 'what did I do to my poor body'.
								After the doctors could find nothing medically wrong with me,
								I went to see a Naturopath and so began my health journey. The more I learnt, the more I wanted to know..
									so I enrolled myself to study a Bachelor of Health Science in Naturopathy and here we are!</p>

								<p>Why did I start NBD? I believe natural health should be practised daily as a form of preventative medicine.
								Imagine how much pressure that would take off our health system!
								I also don't believe that it should be soooo expensive to see a Naturopath..
								learning about my body shouldn't cost me thousands of dollars!!! Seriously!!
								Not only that but change is hard. I have a lifetime of bad habits that I continue to fall back into.
								I know that when I'm surrounded by people who support and help me..
								well it makes it that little bit easier and that's all the difference.
								But we're not just about health, we're also about the environment.
								These two work in synergy with each other and both need to be nurtured and loved.
								Natural By Design is for all of you out there who want to feel good,
								who care about the environment and for those who want control of their own bodies..
								so I'm giving you the how! As for the bubbles and bucha.. that's just because.. why not?! haha</p>

								<h2 class="major">Workshops</h2>
								<p>We offer intimate, 2-3 hour workshops with skilled instructors.
								Our incredible experts have many years experience in their fields and
								are there to guide you or answer any of your questions.</p>

								<h3 class="major"> Herbal Tea Blending</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="/images/herb-about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Do you get that afternoon energy slump? Maybe you have trouble getting to sleep?
									Mixing your own herbal blends is a great and gentle way to treat yourself medicinally.
									Whether you want to beat the bug before flu season or balance your hormones.. herbs have the answer!</p>
								<p>Come along for a great afternoon of tea sipping or a cheeky glass of wine as we learn the healing power of herbs.</p>

									<div class="buy-ticket"></div>
								</a>

								<h3 class="major">Kokedama and Kombucha</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/kokedama.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Our Kokedama workshop teaches the ancient art of Japanese moss balls.
									We think this is a great way to have your own little herb garden in your kitchen or as a decorative feature in your house!
									In the workshop you will make your own and take it home with you..
									before you know it you'll be growing your own little medicine cabinet.</p>


								<h3 class="major">Potions, Lotions and Wine </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/herb-workshops.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Did you know that the average Australian woman absorbs around 515 different chemicals on their body everyday!!
									**insert jaw drop here** Most of these come from our beauty products.
									In our lotions and potions workshop, learn how to mix and make an all
									natural body cream (which you're going to LOVE) and an all natural toothpaste.
									Cut out those nasties and walk away with your own products and a recipe that you can make at home. </p>
